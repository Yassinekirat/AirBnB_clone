1. Clone the repository in order to launch the command interpreter.
2. Open the directory by navigating it with `console.py`.
3. Launch `console.py` for Python 3.

- {create <class>}: Instance creation.
- {show <id> <class>}: Showcase instance.
- {destroy <id> <class>}: Remove the instance.
- {all} [<class>]Show every instance or a particular class.
